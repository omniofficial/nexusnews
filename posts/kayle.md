# Kayle ![kayle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/8b/Kayle_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20190901014208)

Kayle was born to a Targonian Aspect during the Rune Wars, where she honored her mother’s legacy by fighting for justice with her wings of divine flame.
She’s a great hero and the strongest among her kind. This angelic warrior and her sister Morgana protected Demacia for years until Kayle got tired of the repeated failures of mortals—abandoning the realm altogether.
Now, tales are told of her serving justice to evil using her fiery swords, with many hoping that she’ll one day return.
