# Kayle ![kayle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/8b/Kayle_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20190901014208)

Kayle was born to a Targonian Aspect during the Rune Wars, where she honored her mother’s legacy by fighting for justice with her wings of divine flame.
She’s a great hero and the strongest among her kind. This angelic warrior and her sister Morgana protected Demacia for years until Kayle got tired of the repeated failures of mortals—abandoning the realm altogether.
Now, tales are told of her serving justice to evil using her fiery swords, with many hoping that she’ll one day return.

# Abilities
- **Passive** ![q](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/66/Kayle_Divine_Ascent.png/revision/latest?cb=20240813004503) **Divine Ascent** 
- This passive skill lets Kayle’s attacks become empowered by the heavens as she levels up. Kayle’s wings are lit aflame as she gradually gains movement and attack speed and attacks range waves of fire on her spells.
When Kayle reaches levels 1, 6, 11, and 16, she will ascend into a new form and gain additional bonuses.

-Level 1: Kayle’s attack grants her one stack of Zeal for five seconds, stacking up to five times. Each stack gives her 6% bonus attack speed and at max stacks it also gives 8% bonus movement speed.
-Level 6: Kayle’s basic attacks gain range. 
-Level 11: Kayle’s attacks against enemy minions, monsters, and champions unleash a wave of fire in a target direction, inflicting bonus magic damage.
-Level 16: Kayle will be permanently exalted, allowing her to gain bonus attack range.

- Alistar smashes the ground under him, knocking up enemies nearby, and deals 60 to 240 magic damage to all opponents within the area while tossing them into the air—stunning enemies for 1 second.
