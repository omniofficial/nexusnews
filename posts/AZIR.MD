# AZIR ![azir](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/77/Azir_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20150402215409)

Azir was a mortal emperor of Shurima in a far distant age, a proud man who stood at the cusp of immortality. His hubris saw him betrayed and murdered at the moment of his greatest triumph, but now, millennia later, he has been reborn as an Ascended being of immense power. 
With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.

# Abilities
- **Passive** [![passive](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/passive/Azir_Passive.png)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0268/ability_0268_P1.mp4) **Shurima's Legacy** 
- Azir can summon the Disc of the Sun from the ruins of allied or enemy turrets.
  
- **Q** [![q](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/spell/AzirQWrapper.png)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0268/ability_0268_Q1.mp4) **Conquering Sands**
- Azir sends all Sand Soldiers towards a location. Sand Soldiers deal magic damage to enemies they pass through and apply a slow for 1 second.
  
- **W** [![w](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/spell/AzirW.png)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0268/ability_0268_W1.mp4) **Arise!**
- Azir summons a Sand Soldier to attack nearby targets for him, replacing his basic attack against targets within the soldier's range. Their attacks deal magic damage to enemies in a line. Arise! also passively grants attack speed to Azir and his Sand Soldiers.
  
- **E** [![e](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/spell/AzirEWrapper.png)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0268/ability_0268_E1.mp4) **Shifting Sands**
- Azir shields himself briefly and dashes to one of his Sand Soldiers, damaging enemies. If he hits an enemy champion, he instantly readies a new Sand Soldier for deployment and halts his dash.
  
- **R** [![r](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/spell/AzirR.png)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0268/ability_0268_R1.mp4) **Emperor's Divide**
- Azir summons a wall of soldiers which charge forward, knocking back and damaging enemies.

# TIPS AND TRICKS
- To perform the famous “Magical Journey” strategy, you need to have one solder placed down and E, and while in mid-air, move the mouse in a different direction while pressing Q before Azir lands on the solder. Doing this makes your E travel further and deal damage to enemies on both your E and Q along the way. 
- After you hit six, you’ll get a significant advantage over the opponents. You can do this by strategically placing a soldier ahead and trick the enemy into thinking you’ve abandoned that soldier as they push to your turret, allowing you to E to it and ult them into your turret. 
- This trick lets you chase enemies, slowing them down and damaging them without placing your champion in danger. Plus, it reduces the time your enemy has to dodge your Q, but keep in mind this puts your only dash on cooldown, so you need to make sure you’ll be able to hit your targets. Do this by placing a soldier that you E to, but wait until Azir lands and then Q. Try to Q quickly after landing. 
- Remember that maxing W doesn’t increase soldier damage to a unit or tower. Instead, max E first to give you a chance to escape no matter the circumstances. 
- If you E towards opponents and then hourglass with a small amount of time between you landing and hitting them, you’ll hit them alongside knocking them up while doing an hourglass. Doing this is a great way to bait enemy champions.
