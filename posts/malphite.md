Malphite is a colossal living stone creature, helping impose blessed order on a chaotic world.

He was born as a servitor-shard to a magical obelisk known as the Monolith. He used his elemental strength in protecting his progenitor but failed.

Now, as the only survivor of the destruction that occurred, Malphite tries to get along with Runeterra’s soft folk, struggling to find a new role worthy of honoring the last of his kind.
