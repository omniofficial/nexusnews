# Malphite ![malphite](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/10/Malphite_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20150402220554)

Malphite is a colossal living stone creature, helping impose blessed order on a chaotic world.

He was born as a servitor-shard to a magical obelisk known as the Monolith. He used his elemental strength in protecting his progenitor but failed.

Now, as the only survivor of the destruction that occurred, Malphite tries to get along with Runeterra’s soft folk, struggling to find a new role worthy of honoring the last of his kind.

# Abilities

- **R** [![r](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/spell/UFSlash.png)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0054/ability_0054_R1.mp4) **Unstoppable Force**

# TIPS AND TRICKS
- Malphite’s one of the champions in League of Legends that’s a generally excellent all-around tank. He’s a living shard from the Monolith that can deal decent damage and hold himself.
- Malphite has become relatively popular thanks to his ability to withstand heavy blows and synergy with any team. He can be a great Jungler and support champion as well.
- Armor reduces the attacks through Malphite’s Granite Shield, so use Brutal Strikes to strengthen the shield against physical damage.
- Although Malphite’s abilities scale off of armor, some fights require him to get bonus magic resistance. You can achieve that through using Aegis of the Legion or Mercury’s Treads.
- Malphite is a champion that’s highly durable and boasts stellar team-fighting potential. It’s best to use him in the top lane, as support or Jungle.
- Using Granite Shield can make Malphite more “tanky,” helping him absorb as much damage as possible, and it’s a great skill that helps him cope with enemy poke.
- In addition to Granite Shield, Malphite’s passive gradually provides him with a shield, depending on his max health.
- Malphite’s Granite Shield can make recalling safer since enemy units have to break it to stop his channeling.
- If you’re going against ranged champions or mages, max out Seismic Shard first.
- Use Malphite’s Seismic Shard for running away or disengaging. You can also use it to run up to opponents to start your combo.
- You can use Brutal Strike to clear minion waves and Jungle camps when fighting extended trades.
- It’s best to max out Ground Slam first if the enemy units you’re going against are melee and rely on their auto-attacks.
- Malphite’s Ground Slam’s attack speed slow effect is an excellent ability to use against AD champions to minimize their damage output.
- Ground Slam can damage armor, so you’ll be able to inflict a lot of damage even when going against tanks like Garen.
- To eliminate minion waves and monsters, use Ground Slam with Brutal Strikes.
