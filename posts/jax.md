# Jax ![jax](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/f/f5/Jax_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20230926225838)

Jax, known as the Grandmaster at Arms, is a mysterious warrior and mercenary renowned for his outworldly combat skills and biting sarcasm.

Before joining the League, this lone warrior was one of the best soldiers-for-hire. He’s the last known weapon master of Icathia.

After Jax’s homeland was laid low by its hubris by unleashing the Void, he vowed to protect what little remained of Kohari.

As magic now rises in the world, the Void poses huge trouble once more, and Jax roams Valoran to recruit worthy and robust allies to fight alongside him.

# TIPS AND TRICKS

Jax is one of the best duelists in League of Legends because of his powerful kit. He’s a fighter champion who usually occupies Top Lane. He’s an excellent choice among the melee champions, especially when fighting against other champions relying on auto-attacking.
Here are tips and tricks to help you master Jax’s playstyle in no time:

- You can use Jax’s Leap Strike to ally units, including wards, which you can use to plan your escape. 
- Since he’s a fighter, Jax significantly benefits from items with Ability Power and Attack Damage, including Hextech Gunblade. 
- Combine Leap Strike and Empower to secure last hits or for fast hit-and-run bursts. 
- If you see mobile enemy units, make sure to max out Leap Strike first. However, for every other situation, it’s best to max out Empower. 
- It’s best to max out Empower first since its damage increases while the cooldown decreases, making Jax stronger in extended 1v1 fights. 
- Although Empower can’t affect structures, you can activate it for Jax’s auto-attack reset, and Sheen proc if you have the item. 
- It’s wise to max Counter-Strike last since it’s a utility spell and possesses low base damage. 
- Counter-Strike can block minion attacks, allowing the champion to walk up to his opponent and hit them with a fully-charged Counter-Strike. 
- Only activate Counter-Strike if enemy units are near enough, and you’re sure they won’t escape. 
- If you practice well enough, you can use Jax to stun most of the enemy team using Counter-Strike alongside Leap Strike. 
- Jax’s Counter-Strike skill can help reduce damage from enemy champions with AoE abilities, including Requiem. You can save this during team fights or skirmishes. 
- Use the Grandmaster’s Might active effect to protect Jax from bursts of damage. 
- Land two basic attacks on enemy minions, and use the Empower on your third hit of Grandmaster’s Might to gain a massive burst of damage. 
- Make sure to wait before using Grandmaster’s Might active effect if you’ll receive invulnerability or AD/AP buffs to get the most out of it. 
- Before fighting with an enemy unit, gather some stacks from Jax’s passive to get bonus attack speed. 
- Empower grants 50 range. It also resets basic attack timer. 
- Counter-Strike allows you to dodge abilities triggering on-hit effects, including Gangplank’s and Ezreal’s Q. 
- Because of Grandmaster’s Might passive, every third auto-attack Jax makes will deal bonus magic damage to enemy units.
