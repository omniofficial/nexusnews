Jax, known as the Grandmaster at Arms, is a mysterious warrior and mercenary renowned for his outworldly combat skills and biting sarcasm.
Before joining the League, this lone warrior was one of the best soldiers-for-hire. He’s the last known weapon master of Icathia.
After Jax’s homeland was laid low by its hubris by unleashing the Void, he vowed to protect what little remained of Kohari.
As magic now rises in the world, the Void poses huge trouble once more, and Jax roams Valoran to recruit worthy and robust allies to fight alongside him.
