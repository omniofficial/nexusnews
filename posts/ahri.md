Innately connected to the magic of the spirit realm, Ahri is a fox-like vastaya who can manipulate her prey's emotions and consume their essence—receiving flashes of their memory and insight from each soul she consumes. Once a powerful yet wayward predator, Ahri is now traveling the world in search of remnants of her ancestors while also trying to replace her stolen memories with ones of her own making.

# Abilities
- **Passive** [![passive](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/passive/Ahri_SoulEater2.png)]([https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0103/ability_0103_P1.mp4) **Triumphant Roar** 
- This active attack lets Alistar gain a stack of “Triumph” whenever he CC’s one enemy with any of his abilities. Every time a little monster or enemy minion dies near him, he’ll gain one stack. When reaching seven stacks, Alistar will consume them all and roar, healing himself around 25 to 161 hp, depending on his levels, including all surrounding allies for double the amount. Plus, Alistar can roar instantly if a nearby champion or epic monster dies.
  
- **Q** [![q](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/8b/Alistar_Pulverize.png/revision/latest?cb=20240906060746)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0012/ability_0012_Q1.mp4) **Pulverize**
- Alistar smashes the ground under him, knocking up enemies nearby, and deals 60 to 240 magic damage to all opponents within the area while tossing them into the air—stunning enemies for 1 second.
  
- **W** [![w](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/f/f6/Alistar_Headbutt.png/revision/latest?cb=20240906060715)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0012/ability_0012_W1.mp4) **Headbutt**
- Headbutt allows Alistar to dashes to enemies, dealing 55 to 275 magic damage upon contact, knowing them back at a distance of 650 units. All targets hit by Headbutt will get stunned for 1 second. He can headbutt enemies through walls.
  
- **E** [![e](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/1c/Alistar_Trample.png/revision/latest?cb=20240906060838)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0012/ability_0012_E1.mp4) **Trample**
- During Trample, Alistar will “trample” the ground, dealing anywhere between 80 to 200 damage over 5 seconds to any nearby enemy, ticking every 0.5 seconds. Each trample pulse hitting one enemy champion gives Alistar 1 Trample stack, usually capped at 5. When you reach 5 Trample stacks, it’ll provide Alistar’s basic attack against a champion a damage boost, inflicting an additional 35 to 290 magic damage at levels 1 to 18 while stunning the target for 1 second.
  
- **R** [![r](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/62/Alistar_Unbreakable_Will.png/revision/latest?cb=20240906061000)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0012/ability_0012_R1.mp4) **Unbreakable Will**
