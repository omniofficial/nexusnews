**Amumu** is a champion that has a role of a tank in League of Legends. This champion provides a lot of crowd control capabilities and a solid amount of damage.

**Amumu** is a sad mummy that becomes very popular for most League of Legends players. His individual crowd control or CC, armored stats, and AoE damage capabilities make Amumu perfect for holding down vital champions and launching surprise attacks during team fights.

# TIPS AND TRICKS:
-The E cooldown lessens by 0.5 seconds when you’re being attacked. So, when you try to kill Raptors, Wolves, and Krugs, focus only on the giant monsters and permit the small ones to strike against you and reduce the E cool down quickly.

-Since W swiftly strains your mana, ensure you turn it on when clearing or fighting the camps. Please turn it off when you need to leave the fight.

-Some champions are hard to hit using the Q, like LeBlanc and Zed. So, if you are fighting to beat opponents, move closer to them and press R, then hit again with your Q.

-If your R is not available, or you simply don’t want to use it, use the Blue Smite to slow down an enemy and make them dodge your Q the hard way instead.

-Finally, save your Flash for the teamfights, where you can simply press R for a massive AOE stun!

-There is no doubt that Amumu is one of the most popular and best gankers in the League of Legends game, especially after hitting level six. For new gamers, please know that Amumu’s Bandage Toss is not used to just hit the opponent champion for a good chunk of damage, but also to trap them for a small amount of time while Amumu is launching himself towards them.
