# Ryze ![ryze](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/23/Ryze_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20160630224634)

Ryze was just a young apprentice when he first learned of the arcane powers that had shaped the world.

His master, a sorcerer named Tyrus of Helia, was a member of an ancient order whose mission had been to gather and protect the most dangerous artifacts in Runeterra. Ryze overheard Tyrus speaking in hushed tones with another mage, discussing something called “World Runes.” When Tyrus noticed his apprentice, he abruptly ended the conversation, tightly clutching the scroll that never left his side.

In spite of the order’s best efforts, knowledge of the Runes began to spread—few could even begin to understand their importance, or the sheer power held within them, and yet all saw them as weapons that could be turned against their rivals. Ryze and Tyrus traveled between the various peoples of Valoran, trying to quell paranoia and encourage restraint. But over time, their missions became increasingly precarious, and Ryze could sense his master’s growing desperation. Finally, in the Noxii territories where Ryze was born, the first cataclysmic blow was struck in what would eventually be known as the Rune Wars.

- When marked by E, Q deals bonus damage and spreads to all nearby affected units, W will root instead of slow, and E spreads its marks farther.
- One of the strongest champions in the late game.
- Has a strong level 3 since he can reset Q twice with W and E.
- Spikes hard each time he ranks up R to increase Q's damage on enemies affected by E.
- Excels with items that boost his ability power, mana pool, and spell survivability.
- Immobile, leaving him vulnerable to ganks.
- Relies far too much on mana.
- Very reliant on gold and levels.
