# Tryndamere ![1](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/c6/Tryndamere_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20150402221636)

Fueled by unbridled fury and rage, Tryndamere once carved his way through the Freljord, openly challenging the greatest warriors of the north to prepare himself for even darker days ahead. The wrathful barbarian has long sought revenge for the annihilation of his clan, though more recently he has found companionship with Ashe, the Avarosan warmother, and a home with her people. His almost inhuman strength and fortitude is legendary, and has delivered him and his new allies countless victories against the greatest of odds.

- Tryndamere's lust for battle becomes so strong that he is unable to die, no matter how wounded he becomes.

# TIPS AND TRICKS
- make sure you don’t consume fury before fighting and wait until you really need the heal to consume it during the fight. You can also q after auto attacking to still get the bonus crit and ad for the auto but you consume fury before you get more from the auto. Same thing works with your spin. Just remember to use it for sustain when you need it.
- sticking on someone is typically the hardest part of killing someone, so think about whether you need to save your spin and/or W to chase or if you can use it right away to gap close. Spinning through minions to generate fury before trading is a good strat. You can also auto and spin away to get a quick short trade that slaps pretty hard if you crit. This can also be done under tower without taking a turret shot if you time it right.
- trynd scales hard in the split and 1v1/1v2. Avoid grouping unless you can find a good flank angle or you’re super fed. It can be tough to group when the enemy can one shot you or cc lock you. You usually do best in a side lane, farming their jungle, sitting in a bush waiting to delete a squishy that walks by.
-  Attacks against turrets will not grant bonus Fury, but will still reset the timer on Fury decay.
-  Undying Rage can be used when affected by crowd control.
-  Basic trick on Trynda Spinning Slash + Flash. Classic Flash trick where you E in the direction you want and then Flash right after the ability cast time.
-  E cooldown reduction is reduced by 1 second whenever Trynda basic attacks critically strike on-hit, increased to 2 seconds against champions.
-   W can be cast even if Tryndamere does not have vision on targets. The ability will lighten up once an enemy champion gets in range, even if invisible for example when someone is recalling in bush or when Teemo is hiding on the bush.
