# Nasus ![nasus](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/4/43/Nasus_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20150402220659)

Nasus is a jackal-headed Ascended being from Shurima. He was a guardian of knowledge and a peerless strategist. As a heroic figure, he was regarded as a demigod by the people of the desert. He was a voracious student, fiercely intelligent who memorized and critiqued the greatest works of Shuriman history and philosophy before he turned ten.

Nasus had a brother Renekton who tended to wear quickly and fight with other local children. Although they do not share the same passion, the brothers were close to one another. Nasus kept an eye on his brother, making sure he didn’t get into too much trouble.

When Nasus came of age, he got in and was welcomed into the prestigious and exclusive Collegium of the Sun. Having the best teachers in the empire, Nasus developed a wide understanding of military strategy and logistics and became the youngest general in history. As a genius and a competent soldier, he used his skills more in planning and not in fighting

# TIPS AND TRICKS
- Nasus starts out weak. Avoid fighting until it has increased several levels. After you have acquired some items, you can start joining skirmishes. In the early game, the focus is on farming. Keep moving and rotating around the map.
- During the mid-game, continuing stacking Siphoning Strike. Continue rotating around the map, helping teammates along. Draw pressure around from enemies to help your allies open up the map.
- In the end game, split push and try to secure towers while your team occupies other areas of the map. Try to draw pressure, while your team is doing something else on the map. If you can’t get more objectives, get back to your team. Use Wither to slow the enemy advance and focus on the nearest enemy champion during the fight.
- Frozen Heart. Incoming instances of post-mitigation basic damage are reduced. Cripples the attack speed of nearby enemies.
