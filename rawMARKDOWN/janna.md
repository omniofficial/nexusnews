# Janna ![janna](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/3/3f/Janna_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20150402220208)

Lol’s support role consists of champions that assist their teammates throughout the game and is a position that suits characters with utility, disengage, or high base damage. One of the best support champions in the game is Janna.

Janna, armed with the blessings and powers of Runeterra’s gales, is a mystic elemental wind spirit protecting the dispossessed of Zaun.

Some people believe Janna was brought into existence by the pleas of Runeterra’s sailors, who diligently prayed for fair winds as they went through treacherous waters and rough storms.

Since her introduction, Janna’s favor and protection have been called in Zaun’s depth, where she became of hope for the needy.

No one knows when or where Janna will appear, but she will always come to help, as legends say.

- By creating a localized change in pressure and temperature, Janna is able to create a small storm that grows in size with time. She can activate the spell again to release the storm. On release this storm will fly towards the direction it was cast in, dealing damage and knocking away any enemies in its path.
  
- **W** [![w](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/spell/SowTheWind.png)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0040/ability_0040_W1.mp4) **Zephyr**

- **E** [![e](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/spell/EyeOfTheStorm.png)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0040/ability_0040_E1.mp4) **Eye Of The Storm**
- Janna conjures a defensive gale that shields an ally champion or turret from incoming damage and increases their Attack Damage.
  
- **R** [![r](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.19.1/img/spell/ReapTheWhirlwind.png)](https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0040/ability_0040_R1.mp4) **Monsoon**
- Janna surrounds herself in a magical storm, throwing enemies back. After the storm has settled, soothing winds heal nearby allies while the ability is active.


# TIPS AND TRICKS
- Timing Janna’s ultimate can help you push enemy units away from wounded allies or separate them from their team.
- Janna’s abilities enable her to have natural mobility that you can use to your advantage.
- Remember that Janna is a “defensive support,” meaning you must use all her abilities to defend and save your allies instead of yourself. Never use Howling Gale during the laning phase as it has high mana costs and cooldown.
- Never use Howling Gale during the laning phase as it has high mana costs and cooldown.
- Quickly firing Howling Gale without the charge-up is a great way to disable the enemy team without giving them time to react.
- It’s wise to plant Howling Gales in uncovered brushes to surprise enemies.
- Always max out Eye of the Storm first for Jana to level 9 as it’s her most used skill in the laning phase.
- Next to the Eye of the Storm, make sure to max out Zephyr as its high movement speed boost can help Janna escape foes easier.
- It’s best to max out Howling Gale last as it gains Janna minor benefits.
- You can use Eye of the Storm on turrets, which also damages ally turrets. So, always use this skill with caution.
- Remember that the AD bonus you get from Eye of the Storm stays as long as Janna’s shield is active.
- Use Monsoon to push enemies against walls to stun them. This move is best used when enemy units dive you in your tower.
- When your team is currently losing, combine Monsoon and Howling Gale to save your allies.
- Never use Monsoon too early in the game, as it can be a waste. It’s best to use the skill until enemies reach your backline.
- Monsoon is a great counter with a team filled with AoE abilities and ultimates, knocking them back, preventing engagement, canceling channeled spells, and healing your allies.
- Using Kleptomancy allows Janna to endure lane pressure by gaining suitable consumable potions and bonus gold.
- Due to Janna’s high cooldowns and constant use of active items, it’s best to have Cosmic Insight on hand.
- Using Approach Velocity can help Janna secure her allies while in danger or assisting in hunting enemies.
