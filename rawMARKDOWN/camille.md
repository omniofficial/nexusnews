# CAMILLE ![camille](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/0/0d/Camille_OriginalSquare.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/42?cb=20170217185322)

Weaponized to operate outside the boundaries of the law, Camille is the Principal Intelligencer of Clan Ferros—an elegant and elite agent who ensures the Piltover machine and its Zaunite underbelly runs smoothly. 
Adaptable and precise, she views sloppy technique as an embarrassment that must be put to order. With a mind as sharp as the blades she bears, Camille's pursuit of superiority through hextech body augmentation has left many to wonder if she is now more machine than woman.

# TIPS AND TRICKS
- As seen in Camille’s abilities, she is a character of precision, so players who use this character must also possess the same trait in order to effectively play the Steel Shadow’s moves and attacks.
- Players of this character must know how to properly use her skills which need to be done in a paced manner and must be placed carefully in order to achieve the maximum effect.
- The Steel Shadow is a very versatile fighter who is really good at running after her single targets as well as slaying them. When this character is properly played, you will be able to grapple your way out as well as dice your target, and slice into the backline of your opponent.
- Camille’s strengths include the ability to hook shot, apply pressure and smoothly sling away as her opponents try to stop her. She is also highly mobile and very precise and is amazing at split- pushing. Her other abilities such as Hex tech Ultimatum and Tactical Sweep enables her to prepare her kills for her affiliates who are planning to make some explosions.
- Among her weaknesses are her shield is more effective in one- on- one combats and not so much in team fights as it is based on her enemy’s damage type, and also for her hook shot to be effective, it needs to be used at the right timing and from an angle that is least expected.
