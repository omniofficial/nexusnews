    </h1>
    <p>
        Malphite is a colossal living stone creature, helping impose blessed
        order on a chaotic world.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was born as a servitor-shard to a magical obelisk known as the
        Monolith. He used his elemental strength in protecting his progenitor
        but failed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, as the only survivor of the destruction that occurred, Malphite
        tries to get along with Runeterra’s soft folk, struggling to find a new
        role worthy of honoring the last of his kind.

            Malphite launches himself to a location at high speed, damaging
            enemies and knocking them into the air.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Malphite’s one of the champions in League of Legends that’s a
            generally excellent all-around tank. He’s a living shard from the
            Monolith that can deal decent damage and hold himself.
        </li>
        <li>
            Malphite has become relatively popular thanks to his ability to
            withstand heavy blows and synergy with any team. He can be a great
            Jungler and support champion as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Armor reduces the attacks through Malphite’s Granite Shield, so use
            Brutal Strikes to strengthen the shield against physical damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Although Malphite’s abilities scale off of armor, some fights
            require him to get bonus magic resistance. You can achieve that
            through using Aegis of the Legion or Mercury’s Treads.
        </li>
        <li>
            Malphite is a champion that’s highly durable and boasts stellar
            team-fighting potential. It’s best to use him in the top lane, as
            support or Jungle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using Granite Shield can make Malphite more “tanky,” helping him
            absorb as much damage as possible, and it’s a great skill that helps
            him cope with enemy poke.
        </li>
        <li>
            In addition to Granite Shield, Malphite’s passive gradually provides
            him with a shield, depending on his max health.
        </li>
        <li>
            Malphite’s Granite Shield can make recalling safer since enemy units
            have to break it to stop his channeling.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you’re going against ranged champions or mages, max out Seismic
            Shard first.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use Malphite’s Seismic Shard for running away or disengaging. You
            can also use it to run up to opponents to start your combo.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can use Brutal Strike to clear minion waves and Jungle camps
            when fighting extended trades.
        </li>
        <li>
            It’s best to max out Ground Slam first if the enemy units you’re
            going against are melee and rely on their auto-attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Malphite’s Ground Slam’s attack speed slow effect is an excellent
            ability to use against AD champions to minimize their damage output.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ground Slam can damage armor, so you’ll be able to inflict a lot of
            damage even when going against tanks like Garen.
        </li>
        <li>
            To eliminate minion waves and monsters, use Ground Slam with Brutal
            Strikes.
