<p>Jax, known as the Grandmaster at Arms, is a mysterious warrior and mercenary renowned for his outworldly combat skills and biting sarcasm.</p>
<p>Before joining the League, this lone warrior was one of the best soldiers-for-hire. He’s the last known weapon master of Icathia.</p>
<p>After Jax’s homeland was laid low by its hubris by unleashing the Void, he vowed to protect what little remained of Kohari.</p>
<p>As magic now rises in the world, the Void poses huge trouble once more, and Jax roams Valoran to recruit worthy and robust allies to fight alongside him.</p>

<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<p>Jax is one of the best duelists in League of Legends because of his powerful kit. He’s a fighter champion who usually occupies Top Lane. He’s an excellent choice among the melee champions, especially when fighting against other champions relying on auto-attacking.
Here are tips and tricks to help you master Jax’s playstyle in no time:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use Jax’s Leap Strike to ally units, including wards, which you can use to plan your escape. </li>
<li>Since he’s a fighter, Jax significantly benefits from items with Ability Power and Attack Damage, including Hextech Gunblade. </li>
<li>Combine Leap Strike and Empower to secure last hits or for fast hit-and-run bursts. </li>
<li>If you see mobile enemy units, make sure to max out Leap Strike first. However, for every other situation, it’s best to max out Empower. </li>
<li>It’s best to max out Empower first since its damage increases while the cooldown decreases, making Jax stronger in extended 1v1 fights. </li>
<li>Although Empower can’t affect structures, you can activate it for Jax’s auto-attack reset, and Sheen proc if you have the item. </li>
<li>It’s wise to max Counter-Strike last since it’s a utility spell and possesses low base damage. </li>
<li>Counter-Strike can block minion attacks, allowing the champion to walk up to his opponent and hit them with a fully-charged Counter-Strike. </li>
<li>Only activate Counter-Strike if enemy units are near enough, and you’re sure they won’t escape. </li>
<li>If you practice well enough, you can use Jax to stun most of the enemy team using Counter-Strike alongside Leap Strike. </li>
<li>Jax’s Counter-Strike skill can help reduce damage from enemy champions with AoE abilities, including Requiem. You can save this during team fights or skirmishes. </li>
<li>Use the Grandmaster’s Might active effect to protect Jax from bursts of damage. </li>
<li>Land two basic attacks on enemy minions, and use the Empower on your third hit of Grandmaster’s Might to gain a massive burst of damage. </li>
<li>Make sure to wait before using Grandmaster’s Might active effect if you’ll receive invulnerability or AD/AP buffs to get the most out of it. </li>
<li>Before fighting with an enemy unit, gather some stacks from Jax’s passive to get bonus attack speed. </li>
<li>Empower grants 50 range. It also resets basic attack timer. </li>
<li>Counter-Strike allows you to dodge abilities triggering on-hit effects, including Gangplank’s and Ezreal’s Q. </li>
<li>Because of Grandmaster’s Might passive, every third auto-attack Jax makes will deal bonus magic damage to enemy units.</li>
