            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Abilities Overview</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Ashe's abilities revolve around precision, utility, and
                controlling the enemy team from a distance. Here’s a breakdown
                of her abilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Passive - Focus:</strong> Ashe’s critical strikes
                    build Focus, increasing her attack speed. This makes her a
                    high-damage threat once she builds up her Focus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Q - Ranger's Focus:</strong> This ability empowers
                    Ashe’s attacks, allowing her to deal more damage for a brief
                    period of time. It synergizes well with her passive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>W - Volley:</strong> Ashe fires a spread of arrows
                    in a cone, dealing damage to enemies hit. This ability is
                    key for poke and wave-clear, especially in team fights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>E - Hawkshot:</strong> Ashe sends out a hawk to
                    scout the area, providing vision across the map. It’s
                    excellent for scouting jungle entrances and giving your team
                    vision on objectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>R - Enchanted Crystal Arrow:</strong> Ashe fires a
                    massive arrow that stuns and slows enemies hit. This is one
                    of the most impactful abilities in the game, capable of
                    turning the tide of a team fight with a well-timed shot.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Playstyle and Tips</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Ashe is a champion that excels when played with a focus on
                positioning and timing. Here are a few tips to help you master
                Ashe:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Positioning is Key:</strong> Ashe relies heavily on
                    maintaining a safe distance from enemies. Always be mindful
                    of your position, especially in team fights, so you can dish
                    out damage without putting yourself in danger.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use Volley for Poke:</strong> Ashe’s W ability is
                    great for poking enemies in the laning phase. Use it to
                    harass your opponents, especially when they go for a
                    last-hit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make the Most of Your Ultimate:</strong> Ashe’s R
                    can change the course of a fight, but timing is crucial. Try
                    to catch key enemy champions, like carries or assassins, to
                    disable them for a critical period during a fight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Focus on Vision Control:</strong> Ashe’s E can help
                    your team gain vision in key areas. Use it before objectives
                    spawn, or when you need to check jungle entrances to prevent
                    enemy ambushes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Ashe’s Role in the Meta</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Ashe has been a staple of the bot lane as a marksman for a long
                time. She fits into many different team compositions, offering
                utility and damage. Her ability to kite with her passive and
                control enemies with her crowd control makes her a threat in
                both the early and late game. Her long-range poke and initiation
                power with Enchanted Crystal Arrow allow her to influence fights
                even from a distance, providing both damage and crowd control in
                one package. Ashe has seen competitive success in many seasons,
                and she continues to be a flexible and strong pick for players
                at all levels.
