                resilience, Sejuani can control the battlefield and create chaos
                in enemy lines. Whether in the jungle or as a tank in team
                fights, Sejuani is a champion who thrives on crowd control and
                disruption.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Abilities Overview</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Sejuani’s abilities are focused on controlling the enemy and
                providing utility for her team. Here’s a breakdown of her
                abilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Passive - Fury of the North:</strong> Sejuani’s
                    passive increases her resistance to crowd control effects,
                    while also granting bonus resistances when near allies,
                    making her more durable in team fights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Q - Arctic Assault:</strong> Sejuani charges forward
                    in a targeted direction, knocking aside and stunning any
                    enemy she collides with. This ability is a great tool for
                    both initiation and disengagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>W - Winter's Wrath:</strong> Sejuani swings her
                    flail in a wide area, dealing damage to enemies and applying
                    a slow effect. This ability helps in clearing camps quickly
                    and controlling multiple enemies in a fight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>E - Permafrost:</strong> Sejuani slows down enemies
                    and applies a damaging debuff. This ability synergizes well
                    with her other abilities and helps provide additional crowd
                    control to enemies who are hit by her Q and W.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>R - Glacial Prison:</strong> Sejuani hurls a massive
                    ice ball, stunning and damaging enemies it hits. This
                    ultimate is one of the most effective initiation tools in
                    the game, capable of turning the tide of a team fight when
                    timed correctly.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Playstyle and Tips</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Sejuani is a tanky jungler who thrives in team fights. Here are
                a few tips to help you master Sejuani:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Initiate Fights:</strong> Sejuani’s Q and R are
                    excellent tools for initiating team fights. Look for an
                    opportunity to use Glacial Prison on key enemy targets, like
                    squishy carries, and follow up with Winter’s Wrath for extra
                    crowd control.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Engage With Arctic Assault:</strong> Sejuani’s Q is
                    great for quickly closing the gap on enemies. Use it to
                    either engage or escape, and make sure to hit multiple
                    enemies to maximize its effectiveness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Manage Permafrost:</strong> Make sure you land your
                    E on enemies already hit by your other abilities. This will
                    maximize the damage output and provide additional crowd
                    control when the enemy is most vulnerable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tank and Protect Your Team:</strong> Sejuani can
                    absorb a lot of damage and protect squishy allies. Position
                    yourself well to soak up damage and initiate on key targets
                    during team fights.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Sejuani’s Role in the Meta</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Sejuani is a strong pick in the jungle role due to her crowd
                control, tankiness, and high engage potential. She is
                particularly effective against squishier enemies and carries who
                rely on mobility to escape. Her ultimate, Glacial Prison, can
                often turn the tide of a team fight, and with her other
                abilities providing solid crowd control, Sejuani remains a
                top-tier pick in competitive play. She is particularly popular
                in coordinated team compositions where she can engage fights and
                soak damage for her allies.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Skin Collection</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Sejuani’s fierce, battle-ready design has inspired several skins
                over the years. Some of her most popular skins include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Winter Wonder Sejuani:</strong> A festive,
                    snow-themed skin that gives Sejuani a cheerful and bright
                    appearance, complete with icy effects on her abilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Steel Dragon Sejuani:</strong> A powerful and
                    intimidating skin that gives Sejuani a dragon-inspired look,
                    with fiery effects and a more menacing presence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Battle Queen Sejuani:</strong> A regal skin where
                    Sejuani is dressed as a queen of battle, wielding an elegant
                    yet deadly appearance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Beast Hunter Sejuani:</strong> This skin transforms
                    Sejuani into a savage beast hunter, with a rough, primal
                    look and animalistic effects on her abilities.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Lore</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Sejuani is the brutal and fierce ruler of the Freljord’s
                Winter’s Claw tribe. She is a warrior of unrivaled skill and
                courage, leading her people with an iron fist to claim what is
                rightfully theirs. Sejuani rides into battle on her mighty
                warboar, Bristle, and her relentless pursuit of victory is
                guided by a single purpose: to ensure the survival of her tribe
                in the harsh, unforgiving lands of Freljord. As the Winter’s
                Wrath, Sejuani commands respect and fear, and she will stop at
                nothing to see her enemies crushed beneath the weight of her
                will.
            </p>
