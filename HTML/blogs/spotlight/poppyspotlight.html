            <p class="post-text">
                Poppy, the Iron Ambassador, is a tanky support champion in
                League of Legends with the power to initiate fights, protect her
                allies, and deal substantial damage when played correctly. She
                excels in both the top lane and as a jungler. Poppy is known for
                her crowd control abilities, making her an excellent choice for
                those who enjoy playing a disruptive tank who can change the
                course of team fights with her versatile kit.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Abilities Overview</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Poppy’s abilities focus on controlling the enemy and protecting
                her team. Here’s a breakdown of her abilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Passive - Iron Ambassador:</strong> Poppy’s passive
                    allows her to throw her hammer to a nearby ally or herself,
                    granting a shield when they catch it. This helps with
                    survivability and positioning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Q - Hammer Shock:</strong> Poppy slams her hammer in
                    front of her, dealing damage and briefly stunning enemies
                    hit. It’s a useful tool for poking and crowd control in both
                    lane and team fights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>W - Steadfast Presence:</strong> Poppy creates an
                    area around her that prevents enemies from dashing through
                    it. This ability is especially useful against champions with
                    mobility and dash-based engages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>E - Heroic Charge:</strong> Poppy charges an enemy
                    into a wall, stunning them and dealing damage. This ability
                    is a powerful tool for disrupting enemy positioning and
                    isolating key targets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>R - Keeper's Verdict:</strong> Poppy slams her
                    hammer into the ground, knocking enemies back in a large
                    area in front of her. This ultimate can knock key enemy
                    champions out of a team fight and disrupt the enemy’s
                    formation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Playstyle and Tips</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Poppy is a champion who excels at disrupting the enemy team and
                protecting her allies. Here are a few tips to help you master
                Poppy:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Positioning is Crucial:</strong> Poppy thrives when
                    you can effectively control the positioning of your enemies.
                    Use your E to isolate enemy carries and your W to prevent
                    dangerous engages from high-mobility champions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Make the Most of Your Ultimate:</strong> Poppy’s R
                    is one of the best displacement abilities in the game. Use
                    it to knock enemies out of key areas, such as objectives or
                    away from your carries during team fights.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Protect Your Team:</strong> Poppy is a great team
                    protector. Use your W to block dashes and your Q to peel for
                    your allies when they are under threat from assassins or
                    divers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Look for Wall Stuns:</strong> Your E ability can be
                    a game-changer if you can slam enemies into walls for the
                    stun. Be sure to position carefully and predict where your
                    enemies will be to maximize this ability’s effectiveness.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Poppy’s Role in the Meta</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Poppy has remained a popular pick in both top lane and the
                jungle due to her tankiness and crowd control. She offers
                utility to her team with her ability to deny enemy mobility and
                protect squishier allies. Her R can also change the course of a
                team fight, making her a strong presence in the late game. While
                she may not deal the highest damage, her ability to initiate,
                peel, and disrupt enemies makes her a valuable asset on any
                team.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Skin Collection</h2>
            <p class="post-text">

                stature, Poppy’s strength and determination are unmatched. Her
                quest to find the legendary hero she was destined to protect
                drives her forward, as she continues to seek out her true
