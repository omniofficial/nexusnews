            <h2 class="sub-heading">Ekko's Origins</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Ekko is a young inventor from the city of Zaun, known for his remarkable genius and incredible potential. From a young age, he was captivated by time manipulation, driven by the desire to change the past and right wrongs in his life. His brilliant mind led him to create the "Z-Drive," a device capable of manipulating time itself, granting Ekko the ability to rewind events for a second chance.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="sub-heading">The Boy Who Shattered Time</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Ekko grew up in the dangerous undercity of Zaun, a place where the harsh realities of life shaped his resilience. Faced with adversity and corruption around him, Ekko used his intellect and resourcefulness to survive. His greatest invention, the Z-Drive, allowed him to manipulate time, a gift that became both a blessing and a curse. However, this invention also made him a target for powerful figures, and Ekko's quest to protect those he loves often puts him at odds with the authorities.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Abilities and Playstyle</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Ekko is a versatile assassin in League of Legends, excelling in both the mid-lane and jungle roles. His ability to control time through his Z-Drive allows him to outplay enemies by manipulating positioning and dodging abilities. Ekko's ultimate ability, "Chronobreak," lets him rewind time to a previous position, healing him and dealing massive damage to enemies in the process, making him a potent threat in team fights.
            </p>
            <p class="post-text">
                Ekko’s kit also includes the following abilities:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Passive - Z-Drive Resonance:</strong> Ekko's attacks and abilities deal bonus damage after hitting enemies multiple times, providing an extra burst of damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Q - Timewinder:</strong> Ekko throws a disk that damages and slows enemies. The disk returns to him, dealing additional damage if it hits the enemy twice.</li>
                    <li><strong>W - Parallel Convergence:</strong> Ekko creates a stasis field that stuns enemies within its radius if they are caught inside when it activates.</li>
                    <li><strong>E - Phase Dive:</strong> Ekko dashes a short distance, and his next attack deals bonus damage to an enemy.</li>
                    <li><strong>R - Chronobreak:</strong> Ekko rewinds to a previous position and heals for a portion of his health while dealing significant damage to enemies near that spot.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Personality and Motivation</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Ekko is not only a brilliant inventor but also a determined and compassionate individual. Though he harbors a deep desire to change the past, his motivations are not solely selfish. Ekko fights for the people of Zaun, a community often overlooked and mistreated by those in power. His idealism is tempered by the harsh reality of life in Zaun, where survival often requires making tough choices. Ekko is a protector, not just of his friends but of a future he believes can be better—one where time, and the past, can be rewritten for the greater good.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Ekko's Legacy</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Despite the weight of his past, Ekko’s journey is one of self-discovery and change. As he continues to fight for his home, he seeks to use his genius for a future where he can reshape the course of history. Ekko's legacy as the boy who shattered time has made him a symbol of hope for the people of Zaun, a reminder that anyone, no matter how young or small, has the power to make a difference.
