            <h2 class="sub-heading">Champion Adjustments</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Patch 14.21 brings a range of changes to some of the most
                popular champions in the game. Riot Games continues to fine-tune
                balance with these adjustments, making sure the meta remains
                dynamic and diverse.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ahri:</strong> Ahri receives a slight buff to her
                    charm duration and overall mobility. Her ability to maneuver
                    around team fights and influence the battlefield will make
                    her more impactful in the late game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lee Sin:</strong> Lee Sin sees a slight reduction in
                    damage on his Q ability, but a slight increase in sustain
                    through his passive. This change aims to make him more
                    durable in the early stages of the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Jhin:</strong> Jhin's ultimate now has a lower
                    cooldown, allowing him to play more aggressively and apply
                    more pressure during team fights. His damage scaling also
                    improves to increase his relevance late game.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Item Updates</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Several items have been updated to balance their power,
                particularly in terms of sustain and overall effectiveness in
                various game modes.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Divine Sunderer:</strong> The healing provided from
                    this item has been reduced in order to curb its overuse in
                    bruiser builds, especially in the early game where it
                    provided excessive sustain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ravenous Hydra:</strong> The lifesteal on this item
                    has been increased slightly, offering stronger sustain for
                    AD champions who focus on scaling into the late game.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">System Changes</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                The patch also introduces changes to various systems to enhance
                gameplay and improve quality of life for players.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Minion Changes:</strong> A small change has been
                    made to how minions interact with champions, providing more
                    consistent experience gains for solo laners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Jungle Changes:</strong> The jungle has seen an
                    increase in XP rewards for camps in the early game, allowing
                    junglers to ramp up quicker and support their teams more
                    effectively in the early skirmishes.
                </li>
            </ul>
