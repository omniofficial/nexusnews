                Worlds 2025 marks the beginning of a new era for competitive
                League of Legends. With the game's evolving meta, new champions,
                and innovative strategies, teams will need to adapt quickly to
                stay ahead of their rivals. Expect surprises, intense matchups,
                and emerging talents from regions that have been working hard to
                challenge the traditional powerhouses. The stage is set for
                thrilling upsets and historic moments that will go down in

                Global Representation: Who Will Dominate?
            </h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                As always, Worlds will feature teams from all over the world.
                From the established titans of LCK (Korea) and LPL (China) to
                the underdog regions like LEC (Europe) and LCS (North America),
                the competition will be fierce. Each region has a story to tell,
                with its top teams striving to claim glory on the international
                stage. Will Korea continue its dominance, or will China take
                over the crown? Can Europe or North America overcome their
                rivals and bring home their first Worlds victory since 2018 and
                2021, respectively? The world’s best will compete, but only one
                will emerge victorious.

                In 2025, the Worlds format has been revamped to further enhance
                the experience for both players and fans. The group stages will
                feature a new round-robin structure, ensuring that all teams
                face each other in intense matchups. The knockout stage will
                continue to follow a best-of-five format, where only the
                strongest teams will survive and fight for the championship.
                Expect strategic innovations, high-pressure moments, and
                captivating storylines to unfold as the tournament progresses.
