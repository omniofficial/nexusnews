            <h2 class="sub-heading">The Rise of Viego</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Viego, the Ruined King, was once a beloved ruler of the kingdom of Camavor. His reign, marked by prosperity and peace, was overshadowed by an event that would seal his fate and doom his people. Driven by an obsessive desire to resurrect his lost queen, Isolde, Viego unleashed a cataclysmic curse that destroyed his kingdom and corrupted the land.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">The Fall of Camavor</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Viego's descent into madness began when his queen fell mortally ill. Despite his desperate attempts to save her, Isolde died in his arms. Devastated, Viego sought to undo death itself, and in his search for forbidden magic, he discovered a dark and ancient power. In his quest to bring Isolde back, Viego unknowingly released a force that would obliterate his kingdom, turning his people into wraiths and casting the land into ruin.

            <h2 class="sub-heading">The Curse of the Ruined King</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Viego's madness and the dark magic he unleashed became the curse of the Ruined King. This curse not only ravaged Camavor but also spread across the world, infecting those who came into contact with it. Viego's obsession with resurrecting Isolde consumed him, turning him into a vengeful and broken soul. His cursed soul, along with his army of wraiths, continued to plague Runeterra, spreading chaos wherever they went.

            <h2 class="sub-heading">The Champions of the Ruined King</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                The Ruined King’s influence has corrupted several champions, turning them into wraiths and twisted versions of themselves. Below are some of the most notable figures that have been affected by Viego’s curse:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Viego:</strong> Once a king, now a fallen ruler whose obsession with reviving his queen drives him to destroy everything in his path. His abilities revolve around his ability to possess others and unleash his destructive powers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Akshan:</strong> A young marksman and the hero who seeks vengeance against the Ruined King. Akshan’s quest is to stop Viego and free those who have been consumed by his curse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Senna:</strong> Once a sentinel of light, Senna's soul was trapped by Viego’s forces. Now freed from her prison, she fights alongside others to stop the Ruined King and his cursed influence from spreading further.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gwen:</strong> A doll created by the magic of Viego's kingdom, Gwen's tragic story intertwines with Viego’s curse, and she seeks to stop him and protect those still trapped in his dark world.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">The Battle for Redemption</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Viego’s continued obsession with resurrecting Isolde has set him on a path of destruction that will not end until he either finds redemption or consumes everything in his path. He remains a tragic figure, a ruler whose heart was consumed by grief and madness. His battle is one of unrelenting sorrow, as he searches for a way to bring back his queen, even at the cost of the world itself.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">The Legacy of the Ruined King</h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                The legacy of the Ruined King is one of destruction, obsession, and sorrow. Though his kingdom of Camavor is no more, his curse lives on, affecting those who seek to stop him and those who have already been consumed by his madness. The story of Viego is a reminder of how the pursuit of unchecked power and the inability to let go of the past can lead to devastation and ruin. His legacy will haunt Runeterra until his curse is finally broken, or until he has been stopped for good.
