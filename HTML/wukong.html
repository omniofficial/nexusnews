<p>Wukong is a vastayan trickster who uses his strength, agility, and intelligence to confuse his opponents and gain the upper hand. After finding a lifelong friend in the warrior known as Master Yi, Wukong became the last student of the ancient martial art known as Wuju. Armed with an enchanted staff, Wukong seeks to prevent Ionia from falling to ruin.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Wukong becomes stealthed for 1.5 seconds and leaves an uncontrollable decoy that doesn&#39;t attack or move from the place he activated it. The decoy will deal magic damage to nearby enemies after 1.5 seconds.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>R</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0062/ability_0062_R1.mp4"><img

</li>
<li>Wukong&#39;s staff grows outward and he spins it around for up to 4 seconds, dealing damage every second and knocking up enemies once per cast. Wukong gains 5% movement speed bonus every half second for the duration of the spell, with the bonus disappearing once he stops spinning. Wukong cannot attack or use other abilities while Cyclone is on, but he can deactivate it at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Decoy and Nimbus Strike work well together to quickly strike your enemy and get out before they can retaliate.</li>
<li>Wukong can be a decent tank due to his Stone Skin passive as well as being able to dodge abilities with Decoy. Wukong can be a very effective AoE assassin, with Crushing Blow, Nimbus Strike and deals very high damage with a knock-up with Cyclone Cyclone, as well as being able to covertly dive in and slay any vital carries on the enemy team. Wukong can also be used as the usual bruiser/fighter style, engaging and disengaging with solid damage and solid survivability.</li>
<li>Top lane is commonplace for Wukong as he can benefit from the eventual use of semi-defensive-offensive build path that is already recommended for him. Top lane is usually where semi-tanks and tanks are placed and where damage is not so focused on. Most of his matchups top tend to usually be even or at a disadvantage, due to Wukong&#39;s lack of natural sustain and reliable harass. This can often be exacerbated further with matchups against champions such as Lee Sin, Renekton, Garen, Darius or Olaf, who can out-damage or out-sustain Wukong early and often force him to play passively. Champions like Teemo can also easily shut-down some of Wukong&#39;s approaches by delaying him and poking him from a distance before he gets dangerous, so he often needs to rely on an assassin-like mindset to stand out in-lane (such as using Decoy to either escape or use as a form of offensive assassin-style stealth), though Wukong Wukong&#39;s offense is easily baited if he&#39;s not careful.</li>
