        src="/images/champ icon/Master_YiSquare.webp" alt="yi"></h1>
<p>Master Yi has tempered his body and sharpened his mind, so that thought and action have become almost as one. Though he chooses to enter into violence only as a last resort, the grace and speed of his blade ensures resolution is always swift. As one of the last living practitioners of the Ionia Crest icon Ionian art of Wuju, Yi has devoted his life to continuing the legacy of his peopleâ€”scrutinizing potential new disciples with the Seven Lenses of Insight to identify the most worthy among them.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Master Yi teleports across the battlefield with blinding speed, dealing physical damage to multiple units in his path, while simultaneously becoming untargetable. Alpha Strike can critically strike and deals bonus physical damage to monsters. Basic attacks reduce Alpha Strike&#39;s cooldown.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Master Yi rejuvenates his body by focus of mind, restoring Health and taking reduced damage for a short time. In addition, Master Yi will gain stacks of Double Strike and pause the remaining duration on Wuju Style and Highlander for each second he channels.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>E</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0011/ability_0011_E1.mp4"><img

<li><p><strong>R</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0011/ability_0011_R1.mp4"><img 
    src="/images/champ icon/Master_Yi_Highlander.webp" alt="r"></a> <strong>Highlander</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Master Yi moves with unparalleled agility, temporarily increasing his Move Speed and Attack Speed as well as making him immune to all slowing effects. While active, Champion kills or assists extend Highlander&#39;s duration. Passively reduces cooldown for his other abilities on a kill or assist.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Can initiate tower dives early on and try to get kills once his laner pushes the wave in. His Alpha Strike and Meditate allows him to drop tower aggro and take reduced tower damage respectively.</li>
<li>Is a scaling monster, and if he manages to get his items and hit the mid-to-late game, he will be almost unstoppable. For a squishy champion, he can one-man the Baron if he is ahead</li>
<li>His Ultimate Highlander can completely shift the tide of a fight if he is left unchecked. This allows him to use his Alpha Strike frequently, which allows him to avoid CC. Combined with his Wuju Style, he deals a lot of damage.</li>
<li>His early game objective control is phenomenal, especially if his laners have lane priority. He needs to avoid showing up on the map early on, though.Level six is a significant spike for Master Yi as he can now gank and clean up fights reliably. His Alpha Strike usage will determine if all-ins are successful or not.The first item is a good spike for Master Yi as it gives him increased damage. It will help him with clean-ups, and his Jungle clears.</li>
