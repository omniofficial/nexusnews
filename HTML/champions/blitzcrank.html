<p>Blitzcrank is an enormous, near-indestructible automaton from Zaun, originally built to dispose of hazardous waste. However, he found this primary purpose too restricting, and modified his own form to better serve the fragile people of the Sump. 
Blitzcrank selflessly uses his strength and durability to protect others, extending a helpful metal fist or burst of energy to subdue any troublemakers.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<ul>
<li>When going against an enemy champion, take advantage of the 1-2-3 combo of Rocket Grab, Power Fist, and Static Field to inflict devastating damage. Additionally, using this combo under your tower can inflict even more damage thanks to tower shots.</li>
<li>Blitzcrank can’t contribute enough damage to eliminate a target with full health, so never engage with an enemy without making sure your team has your back.</li>
<li>Never let Blitzcrank’s ultimate level up after you hit level six because if you level it up after hooking someone, the lightning will hit whoever you pulled.</li>
<li>Remember that hook fires from Blitzcrank’s right hand, so remember you’ll slide by minions more often on the right side than the left.</li>
<li>Blitzcrank’s kit allows them to stick around enemy forces during a fight, making your allies more confident to follow up, blowing a devastating attack.</li>
<li>If you’re below D3, remember to invade after you buy items fast. That’s because the zoning potential from warding deep early can make your invades a thousand times stronger.</li>
<li>Save Blitzcrank’s ultimate as a finisher early in the game since the lightning procs can inflict more damage than you’d think, so you’ll want to get as many as possible.</li>
<li>When playing Blitzcrank and you are on the red side of the map, you can make your way into the dragon pit and either fire your Q into the tribush or into the bush that is guarding one of the river entrances into the enemy red side, \
most of the time this will lead into a kill and give a lead to your team</li>
<li>When playing Blitzcrank try to make picks for your team by hooking enemies over the wall as Blitzcrank’s hook is the best when it comes to pulling enemies towards him</li>
<li>If an enemy has Edge of Night or Banshee’s Veil try to proc it before the start of a teamfight especially if the enemy is an assassin and your carry is a squishy champion as they will target the carries as long as they are squishy,
by putting the Edge of Night or Banshee’s Veil on cooldown you will be able to knock up the assassin with your E the same second the assassin jumps on your carry in the team.</li>
