<p>Iceborn warmother of the Avarosan tribe, Ashe commands the most populous horde in the north. Stoic, intelligent, and idealistic, yet uncomfortable with her role as leader, 
she taps into the ancestral magics of her lineage to wield a bow of True Ice. With her people&#39;s belief that she is the mythological hero Avarosa reincarnated, Ashe hopes to unify the Freljord once more by retaking their ancient, tribal lands.</p>

<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<p>Ashe uses her weapon’s aim down sights to line up a good damage shot and swiftly fires her rifle from the hip. She is not alone in the war zone; she can call for help from her best ally, Bob, to unite with her when the tension arises.
With Ashe’s full control of the game, she can provide high-impact damage and deliver the ability to harass the enemy. It’s complimenting her to be one of the strongest warriors in the game. With all her given abilities, she can provide a good and successful play.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ashe doesn’t own an offensive power to keep up with the game independently, so as much as possible, stick up with your team when grouping up is starting.</li>
<li>The only defense of Ashe is her kiting ability, so be more conscious of sudden signs and invasion of engagement.</li>
<li>It’s best to focus on one opponent first since Ashe’s Frost Shot ability becomes even more powerful.</li>
<li>The secondary role of Ashe is to give support, so bringing her in your team while you’re doing other objectives will fiercely reinforce your advances.</li>
<li>Protect Ashe during a fight because it allows her to attack and lockdown enemies or lay down opponent’s zone control.</li>
<li>Ashe is considered one of the great champions if you only learn how to use her, especially with the stutter-step and kite ability she has. It serves as an essential technique to play, not only with her strengths but also with her weaknesses.</li>
