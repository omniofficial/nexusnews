<p>Abandoning the Kinkou Order and her title of the Fist of Shadow, Akali now strikes alone, ready to be the deadly weapon her people need. Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, 
she has pledged to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali may strike in silence, but her message will be heard loud and clear: fear the assassin with no master.</p>

<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<p>Akali is a fragile and damage-heavy champion that can bring your team to victory with ease. However, the assassin class is known to be notoriously challenging to master,
but there are many combos you can take advantage of to secure victory, including the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>When using the active attack, Five Point Strike, Akali has several options: These include conserving it until reaching high energy to sustain in lane continually, using the low-cooldown ability to bring damage at peak levels at the cost of all her energy, or weaving them with her passive attack, doubling on empowered kama hits.</li>
<li>Akali is best used for killing fragile champions. That’s why it’s best to let your team initiate and strike at the back for a clean finish every time.</li>
<li>Take advantage of the delays between Perfect Execution dashes to unleash multiple strikes. However, this can leave you vulnerable to counterattacks. It’s best to do this using the first dash early on.</li>
<li>Whenever using the Perfect Execution skill, make sure to always stick to the target as you’ll have a hard time killing the target once you’re a bit far, giving opponents a chance to counteract you.</li>
<li>When using the Twilight Shroud, always be careful. That’s because getting caught in the open while using the skill spells a quick end for the champion.</li>
<li>Shuriken Flip doesn’t need to be used for mobility every time, and Perfect Execution goes beyond assassinating targets. Try using a point-blank flip for quick damage or dash past your target and charge up for an empower kama hit alongside Perfect Execution.</li>
<li>Akali will stay obscured for 0.5 seconds whenever re-entering the Twilight Shroud, which opponents can use against you with skill shots. So, be wary within this period.</li>
