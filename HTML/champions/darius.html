<p>There is no greater symbol of Noxian might than Darius, the nation&#39;s most feared and battle-hardened commander. Rising from humble origins to become the Hand of Noxus, 
he cleaves through the empire&#39;s enemiesâ€”many of them Noxians themselves. Knowing that he never doubts his cause is just, and never hesitates once his axe is raised, those who stand against the leader of the Trifarian Legion can expect no mercy.</p>

<li><p>Darius&#39; attacks and damaging abilities cause enemies to bleed for physical damage over 5 seconds, stacking up to 5 times. Darius enrages and gains massive Attack Damage when his target reaches max stacks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0122/ability_0122_Q1.mp4"><img 
    src="/images/champ icon/Darius_Decimate.webp" alt="q"></a> <strong>Decimate</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Darius winds up and swings his axe in a wide circle. Enemies struck by the blade take more damage than those struck by the handle. Darius heals based on enemy champions and large monsters hit by the blade.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>W</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0122/ability_0122_W1.mp4"><img 
    src="/images/champ icon/Darius_Crippling_Strike.webp" alt="w"></a> <strong>Crippling Strike</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Darius&#39;s next attack strikes an enemy&#39;s crucial artery. As they bleed out, their Move Speed is slowed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>E</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0122/ability_0122_E1.mp4"><img

</li>
<li><p>Darius hones his axe, passively causing his physical damage to ignore a percentage of his target&#39;s Armor. When activated, Darius sweeps up his enemies with his axe&#39;s hook and pulls them to him.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>R</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0122/ability_0122_R1.mp4"><img 
    src="/images/champ icon/Darius_Noxian_Guillotine.webp" alt="r"></a> <strong>Noxian Guillotine</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Darius leaps to an enemy champion and strikes a lethal blow, dealing true damage. This damage is increased for each stack of Hemorrhage on the target. If Noxian Guillotine is a killing blow, its cooldown is refreshed for a brief duration.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Take note that your ability to pull in enemies can be utilized through walls. So, better use it to smash unaware enemies for a swift kill, such as in the jungle against the early or mid jungler.</li>
<li>Decimate as a powerful ability of Darius can strike an opponent from a high range and for most significant effect.</li>
<li>Noxian Guillotine can do more damage the more stacks of Hemorrhage the enemy has. Utilize that to deal more damage to your enemies.</li>
<li>Darius can benefit from improved survivability. So the longer you can stall a fight, the more powerful he will become.</li>
