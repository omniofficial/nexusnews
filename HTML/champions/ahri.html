<p>Innately connected to the magic of the spirit realm, Ahri is a fox-like vastaya who can manipulate her prey&#39;s emotions and consume their essence—receiving flashes of their memory and insight from each soul she consumes. Once a powerful yet wayward predator, Ahri is now traveling the world in search of remnants of her ancestors while also trying to replace her stolen memories with ones of her own making.</p>

<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Essence Theft has great sustain, granting your next ability 35%  Spell Vamp. </li>
<li>Orb of Deception deals a very decent amount of damage, dealing magic damage on the way up, and true damage on the way back. Take advantage of the true damage and position yourself correctly againts your enemy.</li>
<li>Spirit Rush is great for chasing down enemy champions, as you&#39;re able to cast Spirit Rush 3 times. It&#39;s also a great escaping ability, over thin walls and such.</li>
<li>Charm is great for initiating againts an enemy champion. Unleash your Q and E (and R with Ignite to for a secure kill if you want it) againts them while the walk harmlessly towards you.</li>
<li>All of Ahri&#39;s abilities can be dodged by dodging or juking. Both Orb of Deceptiong and Charm are line skill shots that are fairly slow, which is easy to get around from.</li>
<li>Mostly staying behind minions negates Ahri from landing her Fox-Fire, Charm, and Spirit Fire from landing directly onto you.</li>
<li>Always remember to step out of the way of Orb of Deception, as it deals true damage on the way back.</li>
<li>Ahri has one of the strongest mid-games, so hard CC can slow her utility down.</li>
