    <h1 id="alistar-alista">ALISTAR <img src="/images/champ icon/AlistarSquare.webp" alt="alista"></h1>
    <p>The tank class in League of Legends online battle consists of strong melee champions who sacrifice significant damage for robust crowd control, effectively breaking any group attacks—separating enemies from one another. Among them, Alistar is one of the most well-known, thanks to his robust disengaged gameplay. </p>

    <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Passive</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0012/ability_0012_P1.mp4"><img src="/images/champ icon/Alistar_Triumphant_Roar.webp" alt="passive"></a> <strong>Triumphant Roar</strong> </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>This active attack lets Alistar gain a stack of “Triumph” whenever he CC’s one enemy with any of his abilities. Every time a little monster or enemy minion dies near him, he’ll gain one stack. When reaching seven stacks, Alistar will consume them all and roar, healing himself around 25 to 161 hp, depending on his levels, including all surrounding allies for double the amount. Plus, Alistar can roar instantly if a nearby champion or epic monster dies.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Q</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0012/ability_0012_Q1.mp4"><img src="/images/champ icon/Alistar_Pulverize.webp" alt="q"></a> <strong>Pulverize</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Alistar smashes the ground under him, knocking up enemies nearby, and deals 60 to 240 magic damage to all opponents within the area while tossing them into the air—stunning enemies for 1 second.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>W</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0012/ability_0012_W1.mp4"><img src="/images/champ icon/Alistar_Headbutt.webp" alt="w"></a> <strong>Headbutt</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Headbutt allows Alistar to dashes to enemies, dealing 55 to 275 magic damage upon contact, knowing them back at a distance of 650 units. All targets hit by Headbutt will get stunned for 1 second. He can headbutt enemies through walls.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>E</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0012/ability_0012_E1.mp4"><img src="/images/champ icon/Alistar_Trample.webp" alt="e"></a> <strong>Trample</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>During Trample, Alistar will “trample” the ground, dealing anywhere between 80 to 200 damage over 5 seconds to any nearby enemy, ticking every 0.5 seconds. Each trample pulse hitting one enemy champion gives Alistar 1 Trample stack, usually capped at 5. When you reach 5 Trample stacks, it’ll provide Alistar’s basic attack against a champion a damage boost, inflicting an additional 35 to 290 magic damage at levels 1 to 18 while stunning the target for 1 second.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>R</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0012/ability_0012_R1.mp4"><img src="/images/champ icon/Alistar_Unbreakable_Will.webp" alt="r"></a> <strong>Unbreakable Will</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li><p>When activating Unbreakable Will, Alistar will remove all forms of CC from himself, and he will reduce incoming physical and magic damage up from 55% to 75% for 7 seconds.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
    <p>Alistar is a mighty minotaur that towers above most champions in League of Legends when it comes to strength and is one of the greatest among his tribe. He’s a moderately complex champion to master and has the function of a DPS but is usually best used for tanking—charging through enemy lines without fear, leading your team to victory. </p>
    <p>Here are tips and tricks that can help you make the most out of Alistar’s brute strength and durability. </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Alistar’s area of effect heal and Triumphant Roar have low costs of mana, so it’s best to take advantage of this and repeatedly use it to keep up with allies.</li>
    <li>Using Unbreakable Will for crowd control is an excellent choice since this will make Alistar extremely challenging to kill and makes him a great distraction to enemy forces.</li>
    <li>When on the “Laning” phase, make Alistar stand close to your ADC at all times, and with excellent positioning, you can threaten and engage enemies even if you don’t want to fight.</li>
    <li>When you’ve engaged in a team fight, retreat as soon as you can protect your ADC and never leave them alone against the enemy frontline—use Alistar to engage and fall back to help them.</li>
    <li>It’s best to stop flashing before you use Alistar’s Pulverize since you can cast his Q before pressing flash, providing a nearly instantaneous knock-up that opponents can’t react to.</li>
    <li>Never use the Headbutt and Pulverize combo whenever you’re too close to the enemy, as it’ll usually fail. Whenever you want to do the combo, make sure you’re at a mid or max-range distance.</li>
    <li>Never use Alistar’s ultimate whenever you’re low on hp unless you’re baiting someone. It’s best to use it before taking damage to mitigate Alistar’s burst and stay in the fight inflicting damage.</li>
    <li>When you are using your E ability, don’t AA because that will stop his stomping animation and will make it longer for the chain to fully complete, it’s best to use E and than move with the enemy champion depending on where they are going because by doing this you will be ready to instantly stun the enemy with your E when the chain completes instead of having to get close to the enemy again</li>
    <li>If the enemy is near your tower you can cast Q flash and walk behind the enemy champion that is knocked up to W them into your tower, if you aren’t confident that you can Q flash fast enough for the instant knock-up you can flash Q the enemy as the Q animation is short so the enemy, most of the time, won’t have enough time to react</li>
    <li>Depending on your enemies, yours and your teams position you can use 1 of the 2 combos, W, Q, E, walk around the enemy till full chain completion, AA or W, flash, Q, E, walk, AA. The first combo is for engaging onto an enemy that is in front of you and your team, by doing this you will cc them long enough for your team to kill them. The second combo is used to boop your enemy to your team if the enemy is located in between you and your team. By doing W flash into Q the enemy won’t have a chance to react with a flash after your W</li>
