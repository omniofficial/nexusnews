<p>Teemo is the fearless leader of the Bandle Scouts—a group of intrepid yordles dedicated to exploring Runeterra Crest icon Runeterra and learning about the great big world. He ventures far and wide, completing challenges to earn merit badges, writing new rules to add to the ever-growing Bandle Scout Handbook, and leaving exploding mushrooms around as a surprise gift for new friends. As a scout leader, nothing bad ever happens when Teemo’s around!</p>
<h1 id="abilities">Abilities</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passive</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0017/ability_0017_P1.mp4"><img 
    src="/images/champ icon/Teemo_Guerrilla_Warfare.webp" alt="passive"></a> <strong>Guerrilla Warfare</strong> </li>
<li>PASSIVE</li>
<li><p>If Teemo stands still and takes no actions for a short duration, he becomes Invisible indefinitely. If he&#39;s in brush, Teemo can enter and maintain his Invisibility while moving. After leaving Invisibility, Teemo gains the Element of Surprise, increasing his Attack Speed for a few seconds.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Q</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0017/ability_0017_Q1.mp4"><img 
    src="/images/champ icon/Teemo_Blinding_Dart.webp" alt="q"></a> <strong>Blinding Dart</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Obscures an enemy&#39;s vision with a powerful venom, dealing damage to the target unit and blinding it for the duration.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>W</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0017/ability_0017_W1.mp4"><img 
    src="/images/champ icon/Teemo_Move_Quick.webp" alt="w"></a><strong>Move Quick</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Teemo scampers around, passively increasing his Move Speed until he is struck by an enemy champion or turret. Teemo can sprint to gain bonus Move Speed that isn&#39;t stopped by being struck for a short time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>E</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0017/ability_0017_E1.mp4"><img 
    src="/images/champ icon/Teemo_Toxic_Shot.webp" alt="e"></a> <strong>Toxic Shot</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Each of Teemo&#39;s attacks will poison the target, dealing damage on impact and each second after for 4 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>R</strong> <a href="https://d28xe8vt774jo5.cloudfront.net/champion-abilities/0017/ability_0017_R1.mp4"><img 
    src="/images/champ icon/Teemo_Noxious_Trap.webp" alt="r"></a> <strong>Noxious Trap</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Teemo throws an explosive poisonous trap using one of the mushrooms stored in his pack. If an enemy steps on the trap, it will release a poisonous cloud, slowing enemies and damaging them over time. If Teemo throws a mushroom onto another mushroom it will bounce, gaining additional range.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use your range advantage to poke melee champions out of lane. Use your Q on them when they look to last hit a Cannon Minion.</li>
<li>Run inside the bush after auto attacking the enemy to reduce incoming damage from minions.</li>
<li>Place a plethora of Shrooms R in the river to reduce the chances of the enemy Jungler.</li>
<li>Strong Against Vayne: Vayne is a short-ranged champion, and Teemo can abuse his range advantage by poking her down with his Q and auto-attacks. Teemo&#39;s shrooms also provide vision and area control, making it challenging for Vayne to engage or reposition effectively.</li>
<li>Strong Against Camille: Teemo&#39;s blind from his Q can negate Camille&#39;s primary source of damage, her Q2. Teemo can kite Camille effectively, avoiding her engage attempts while continuously chipping away at her health with his ranged attacks and shrooms.</li>
<li>Strong Against Darius: Teemo can poke Darius from a distance, avoiding Darius&#39;s Q heal and preventing him from applying his passive stacks effectively. Teemo&#39;s speed boost from his W allows him to dodge Darius&#39;s skill shots and kite him.</li>
