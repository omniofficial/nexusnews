<p>Soraka, a celestial being from beyond Mount Targon, descended to Earth to protect mortals. She gave up her immortality and strived to spread compassion and mercy to everyone she met. Even healing those who would wish harm upon her, like on one occasion where an Ardent Mage was attacking Soraka with dark magic. Instead, he found himself healed by the kindhearted goddess. After seeing all the struggles this world has seen, Soraka still believes that humanity as a whole is capable of more than they think themselves able.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Soraka is the perfect addition to any team, using her healing solid abilities and powerful skills in battle.</li>
<li>Wish is a function in the game where you can call forth your allies to safety from across the map, saving them from otherwise fatal events.</li>
<li>Equinox can keep enemies at bay by creating zones that are inaccessible to them.</li>
<li>Soraka is a support which often works closely with her marksman. She can keep them healthy during the early levels of the lane phase by casting Astral Infusion before turning to Starcall to damage enemy bot laners and restore some health for herself as she uses this ability.</li>
<li>Soraka is a high-skill cap champion with a wide variety of viable runes. Summon Aery will provide the most damage and utility for champions who can land their abilities on enemy heroes consistently. However, Picking Sorcery as your Primary rune tree allows you more diversity in choosing which Rune best suits your playstyle or team composition.</li>
<li>Soraka can be a challenging champion to play well, but everything will go smoothly if you follow this build guide. The best item for Soraka is Ionian Boots of Lucidity, followed by Moonstone Renewer purchase. To finish the stack off with Redemption and or Shard of True Ice as your final items before using Flash and Barrier as summoners spells.</li>
