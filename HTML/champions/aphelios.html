    src="/images/champ icon/Aphelios_OriginalSquare.webp" alt="aphelios"></h1>
<p>Emerging from moonlight&#39;s shadow with weapons drawn, Aphelios kills the enemies of his faith in brooding silence—speaking only through the certainty of his aim, and the firing of each gun. Though fueled by a poison that renders him mute, he is guided by his sister Alune. From her distant temple sanctuary, 
she pushes an arsenal of moonstone weapons into his hands. For as long as the moon shines overhead, Aphelios will never be alone.</p>

<li>Aphelios wields 5 Lunari Weapons made by his sister Alune. He has access to two at a time: one main-hand and one off-hand. Each weapon has a unique Basic Attack and Ability. Attacks and abilities consume a weapon&#39;s ammo. When out of ammo,</li>

</li>
<li>Aphelios has 5 different activated abilities, based on his main-hand weapon: Calibrum (Rifle): Long range shot that marks its target for a long-range follow-up attack. Severum (Scythe Pistol): Run fast while attacking nearby enemies with both weapons.</li>
<li><p>Gravitum (Cannon): Root all enemies slowed by this weapon. Infernum (Flamethrower): Blast enemies in a cone and attack them with your off-hand weapon. Crescendum (Chakram): Deploy a sentry that shoots your off-hand weapon.</p>

</ul>
<p>Individual Weapon Abilities
Aphelios possesses 5 different activated abilities, depending on his main-hand weapon, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Calibrum (The Rifle) – It’s a poke/harass weapon whose basic attacks have extra range. When under the Moonlight Vigil Calibrum Effect, its follow-up attacks can mark all targets hit, dealing higher damage when consumed. Calibrum is considered a sniper rifle.</li>
<li>Crescendum (The Chakram) – This is a close-range DPS weapon acting like a boomerang. It can also deploy sentry shooting off the off-hand weapon. When under the Moonlight Vigil Crescendum Effect, its follow-up attacks increase the damage of basic attacks. </li>
<li>Gravitum (The Cannon) – It’s considered Aphelios’s utility weapon, where it applies a decaying slow effect to targets. It can damage and root all enemies on the map affected by its slow effect. When in Moonlight Vigil Gravitum Effect mode, all follow-up attacks apply a massive slow effect to opponents. </li>
<li>Infernum (The Flamethrower) – It’s an AoE or waveclear weapon, dealing basic attack and ability with increased damage, creating damage cones behind targets hit. It can produce a dusk wave, a wave of damaging enemies. Under the Moonlight Vigil Infernum Effect, every follow-up attack spawns damage circles around targets hit instead of the cones behind. </li>
<li>Severum (The Scythe Pistol) – It’s a “sustain weapon” that can heal Aphelios for a portion of the damage it deals with targets. When you have full health, this grants a small shield instead. It can also gain movement speed, rapidly firing both main-hand and off-hand weapons at the nearest targets,
prioritizing champions. When under the Moonlight Vigil Severum Effect, it grants Aphelios a flat heal.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tips-and-tricks">TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hitting level 2 is the key to mastering Aphelios and unlocking his true potential. To do this, you must kill the first 9 minions (6 melee and 3 casters) situated in the bottom lane. Upon reaching this level, you can look to engage and go for a favorable trade.</li>
<li>All of Aphelios’s weapons contain 50 ammo, so always keep an eye on your ammo and what weapon you’re holding to avoid mishaps while on the battlefield. Don’t get caught out with a gun without any ammo in a trade.When you use Q/R you use 10 ammo.</li>
<li>When fighting against melee champions, switch W to Severum when they attack. This trick gives Aphelios bonus movement speed and rapid-fire from his primary and side weapons, focusing on the closest opponent while retreating.</li>
